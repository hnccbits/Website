    body: (
      <>
        Web Development basically involves the development of front-end and
        back-end.
        <br />
        <br />
        In front-end development, we develop the user-end of the website. For
        front-end you should learn HTML, CSS and Javascript. You should first
        start with front-end development. After having a good command on HTML
        and CSS, you should learn Javascript basics(For simple front-end
        development basics of JS is enough).
        <br />
        <br />
        After the front-end, comes the backend. In the backend you should first
        learn about servers, databases and how the internet works? After that
        pick up a language (any one) such as Python (Django/Flask) preferable if
        you want to increase your tech-stack, You can also prefer Node.js as you
        have already learnt about JS in the front-end, you don’t have to learn
        something new. Learn Database languages like SQL and MongoDB (learn
        both). After that, you should learn any javascript framework which is in
        great demand like ReactJS.
        <br />
        <br />
        Also, keep in mind that each year, lots of new things come in this
        field, so be prepared with old technologies. The new ones are basically
        the modified forms of the old ones.
        <br />
        For learning all these, you can refer to W3Schools, MDN WebDocs, Udemy,
        YouTube or the official documentation of the language.

        Graphic Design is a broad field with various niches. You will need to
        figure out your niche and proceed, which will ultimately come along with
        experience.
        <br />
        <br />
        First of all grab a decent level laptop and try installing Adobe
        Illustrator or Photoshop, and look for some courses for Graphic Design
        on Udemy (Although they are paid but you can get them for free on
        torrent).
        <br />
        Complete the course and parallelly keep exploring about Graphic Design
        on the internet, particularly on YouTube. (Some recommended channels:
        The Futur, GFX Mentor).
        <br />
        <br />
        Follow the above steps, you&apos;ll gradually get to know how to proceed
        further in the world of Media and Graphics. Hope it helps!

        website.
        <br />
        <br />A mid or high core cpu is recommended and if you are thinking of

        AI or artificial intelligence simply means human intelligence exhibited
        by machines.
        <br />
        <br />
        Machine Learning is a subset of AI,it is an algorithm that has the
        capability to learn from its previous experiences and for that we don’t
        have to program it separately.
        <br />
        First thing is to get familiar with the terms that we use in ML like
        features,training etc, secondly we have to understand the use of tools
        like jupyter notebook,pandas,numpy etc.then learn about the common ML
        models like linear regression,decision trees etc and the maths behind
        them.’

        These are some problems that have a huge data set to work on.
        <br />
        So to solve these in a reasonable amount of time, one has to come with
        creative ideas to minimize the time and resources required to solve this
        on a computer.

        Data Structures and Algorithms is the study of these common problems.

        It depends upon your work. But it&apos;s preferable for general use to
        have a high-end laptop with an intel i5 processor or above or Ryzen 5 or
        above along with 8GB RAM and 1TB Hard Disk or, 256GB SSD. Graphics card
        up to 4GB 1050Ti if you want to do graphic designing, video editing, and
        game development.
        <br />
        <strong>For Web Development</strong> : i5 or Ryzen 5 with 8GB RAM
        recommended Android Development: i5 or Ryzen 5 with 8GB RAM recommended
        Graphics Design, Video Editing, 3D Rendering: i5 or Ryzen 5 with 8GB
        RAM, with 2-4 GB Graphics Memory recommended.
        <br />
        <strong>Notes:-</strong>
        <br />
        Try going for an SSD first. SSD increases productivity many fold times.

        <strong>Short Answer</strong>:- Linux is the best operating system for
        developers or programmers.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Long Answer</strong>:- HnCC Members will always suggest you go
        for the open-source operating system Linux. Linux powers the internet,
        system administrators, Supercomputers etc.
        <br />
        For most apps or websites that you use, there is a high probability that
        it might have been powered by a Linux system.
        <br />
        <strong>For a student, learning is the most important</strong>.<br />
        Closed systems like Windows and Mac don’t provide that degree of open
        environment and hackable features like you get on a Linux system which
        is most important for learning and experimenting.
        <br />
        You can read more about the experience of having Linux OS, on the blog

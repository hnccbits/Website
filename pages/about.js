            It has been indeed a pleasure to be the professor In-Charge of the
            Hackathon and Coding Club of BIT Sindri. The organization has been
            aiming to impart knowledge and guidance to the students of the
            college that put their interests into the fields of Computer
            Science, Development, and Designing. The club has been successfully
            been providing the proper guidance, information, and help to the
            people who ask for it. The club has many members that work
            selflessly for the events that the club organizes and for providing
            the best. The club has kept my expression good as I get an
            opportunity to see the enthusiasm the students pose to learn new
            stuff and whats even better, is that the people inducted in the club
            are even more enthusiastic to give away what they know in the best
            way possible. My aspirations from the club include creating a
            dynamic environment for the interest of computer science and its
            applications in the campus, including development and designing
            which is working high in the sky, so that the students excel in
            their fields of interest, and put their ideas into reality. I wish
            the organization all the very best. It makes me honored to be
            associated with a club of such kind.

              Hackathon and Coding Club (HnCC) is the official coding and
              development club of BIT Sindri. It was started with an initial
              motto to inculcate and improve collaborative coding culture in
              college. Our team expanded slowly in numbers and the spectrum of
              activities we deal with, expanded broadly.
